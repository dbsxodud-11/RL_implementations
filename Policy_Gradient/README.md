### Comparative Evaluation

Figure 1 shows the total average return of evaluation during training for REINFORCE, REINFORCE with baseline, Actor-Critic, GAE, PPO, SAC.
I train 3 different instances of each algorithm with different random seeds. The solid curves corresponds to the mean and the shaded region to the minumum and maximum returns over the five trials
